##  Description 
Tripio is a 24-hours-or-less trip planning app that allows users to create their own itineraries, share them publicly, and follow other users' itineraries. While other 24-hour city guides are available online, they usually lack a customization aspect or are tailored to a specific type of traveler (i.e. The New York Times' 36 Hours In column).

We also found that most travel planning apps lack a social component that extends beyond sharing the link directly. Tripio provides a platform where all itineraries are publicly accessible for other users to view. Using the Google Maps/Places API, users are also able to create itineraries easily and streamline their planning process.

## Technologies Used:
* **HTML** is a markup language. It provides structure of a website so that web browsers know what to show

* **Javascript** is used by all web browsers, Meteor and other frameworks 
* **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient
* **Express** is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications
* **MongoDB** is an open-source document database and leading NoSQL database. MongoDB document databases provide high availability and easy scalability.
* **Mongoose** provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model application data
