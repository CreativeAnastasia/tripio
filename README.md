##  Description 
Tripio is a day-trip planning app that allows users to create their own itineraries, share them publicly, and follow others’ itineraries. The planning process is streamlined because Tripio is a one-stop-shop.


## Technologies Used:
* **Javascript** - used by all web browsers, Meteor, and lots of other frameworks 
* **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. 
* **Express** is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
* **MongoDB** is an open-source document database and leading NoSQL database. MongoDB document databases provide high availability and easy scalability.
* **Mongoose** provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data.
* **Google Places API Web Service** features more than 100 million businesses and points of interest that are updated frequently through owner-verified listings and user-moderated contributions.
* **HTML** is a markup language. It provides structure of a website so that web browsers know what to show.
* **Material Design Lite** lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your websites. It doesn’t rely on any JavaScript frameworks and aims to optimize for cross-device use, gracefully degrade in older browsers, and offer an experience that is immediately accessible.
* **CSS** is a Cascading Style Sheet. CSS let’s web designers change colors, fonts, animations, and transitions on the web. They make the web look good.
