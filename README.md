##  Description 
Tripio is a 24-hours-or-less trip planning app that allows users to create their own itineraries, share them publicly, and follow other users' itineraries. While other 24-hour city guides are available online, they usually lack a customization aspect or are tailored to a specific type of traveler (i.e. The New York Times' 36 Hours In column).

We also found that most travel planning apps lack a social component that extends beyond sharing the link directly. Tripio provides a platform where all itineraries are publicly accessible for other users to view. Using the Google Maps/Places API, users are also able to create itineraries easily and streamline their planning process.
